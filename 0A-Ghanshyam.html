							<p>Chhapaiya is a beautiful little village near Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh. All around it there are lots of banyan, pipal, mango, tamarind, guava and pomegranate trees. One finds a forest of jambu trees on its outskirts. There is a constant chirping of birds. The sweet notes of cuckoos, mena, devchaklis, parrots and peacocks, fill the air and enliven the atmosphere. The whole village looks enchanting with its tiny streets, and charming mandirs and houses. It is the night of Monday, 3 April 1781 (Chaitra sud 9, Samvat year 1837). The time is 10 o’clock at night and there is rejoicing in and around the house of Dharmadev. Outside the house children are dancing with joy. Women are joyfully flocking to Dharmadev’s house, singing and carrying large silver plates filled with kumkum, gulal, garlands of flowers and silken clothes in their hands. People are gathering all around the house. Outside, the Brahmins are reciting sacred mantras in the yagna arena. Dharmadev is donating ornaments, clothes and cows to Brahmins, sages and the poor. Rows of lighted lamps, arranged one above the other, give the whole house an enchanting glow. Drums and pipes are playing soulful tunes. But why are all these festivities taking place here tonight? Because a son has been born to Dharmadev and Bhaktimata. And it is Purna Purushottam Narayan, Supreme God, himself who has been born to Bhaktimata. God himself has manifested in the form of this newborn baby. His shining form fills the whole house with divine light and joy. Everyone is astonished to see such radiance. The devas shower flowers and chandan from the sky. Seated in their heavenly chariots, they fly in to have darshan of Dharmadev’s son. Trumpets of victory are sounded all around.</p>
